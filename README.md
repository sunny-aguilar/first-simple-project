# first-simple-project
After a couple of years studying computer science fundamentals, I am now beginning my transition
into web technologies which will eventually lead to learning more about cloud technologies.

## Where I Will Start
My last remaining classes will mostly focus on the web stack of technologies. My first course, CS290 Web Development,
will cover mostly front end but will also cover some back-end technologies such as NodeJS and
ExpressJS.

The class after that will mainly consist of the backend. CS340 Intro to Databases covers the back-end of web development
and we are given a few options in regards to the technologies I would like to cover such as NodeJS and Flask using
Python.
