# first-simple-project
After a couple of years studying computer science fundamentals, I am now beginning my transition
into web technologies which will eventually lead to learning more about cloud technologies.

## Where I Will Start
My last remaining classes will mostly focus on the web stack of technologies. My first course
will cover mostly front end but will also cover some back-end technologies such as NodeJS and
ExpressJS.
